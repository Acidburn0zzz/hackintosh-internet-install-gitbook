# Config.plist Basics

You will need this information, if you already know your way around XML format, it will be a breeze for you \(you still need to read it though\). 

This will show you how to handle your config.plist manually, and I \*\***strongly recommend**\*\* that you learn this properly for the next section.

## \*\*\*\*[**Config.plist Basics - Vanilla Guide**](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/config.plist-basics) **\[THIS IS A LINK\]**

Big thanks to /u/corpnewt for the time and effort put in that guide.

You shall go to the next step only if your read the above, you will have a bad time if not.
